# Guess_The_Year
A simple game that challenges the user to guess the correct year for various historical events.

This Python program connects to a database (years.db) that contains various historical events with their associated years. At the start of the program, the player has the option to add or delete events from the database. Following this step, the events are uploaded from the database and their order is randomized into a new dictionary. The player can then choose a difficulty setting, ranging from impossible (where the beginning score is set to 1) to easy (where the beginning score is set to 1000). Once a difficulty level is set, the events are presented one after another and the palyer is prompted to guess the year. With each guess, correct digits are printed to the screen, while incorrect digits show up as "-". For example, if the event in question was "The Cuban Missile Crisis" and the player guessed "1972", the follwing would be printed out: "19-2" (since the correct year is 1962). For each event, there is not limit to how many guesses the player gets; however, points are deducted from their score with each incorrect guess. The number of points deducted for each guess is based on how far off the guess is and how many guesses they have tried for that event. When the player guesses correctly, their streak is increased by 1 and the next event is presented. When the player's score reaches zero, the game is over and their final streak is printed out.
